# Guide

*We are testing deploying the guide with a DOI -- This is version N+4 of the guide*

This is a guide to software development and projects at the Netherlands eScience Center. It both serves as a source of information for exactly how we work at the eScience Center, and as a basis for discussions and reaching consensus on this topic.

**This Guide is a work in progress**
